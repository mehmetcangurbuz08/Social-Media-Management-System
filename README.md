# Social Media Management System

## Overview
This project implements a social media management application designed to handle user profiles, posts, and interactions efficiently. The system uses custom data structures for optimized storage and retrieval, ensuring fast performance even with large-scale data.

---

## Features
- **User and Post Management:** Create, manage, and update user profiles and posts.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Optimized data retrieval using custom implementations of hash maps and hash sets.
- **Efficient Content Organization:** Handles large volumes of posts and user interactions seamlessly.

## Project Structure

```
SocialMediaManager/
|-- InstagramManager.java         # Core logic for managing users and posts
|-- Main.java                     # Entry point of the application
|-- MyHashMap.java                # Custom implementation of a hash map
|-- MyHashSet.java                # Custom implementation of a hash set
|-- Post.java                     # Represents a social media post
|-- User.java                     # Represents a user profile
```

## How It Works

1. **User and Post Initialization:**
    - Users and their posts are created using the **User** and **Post** classes.
    - Data is stored and managed using custom hash maps for quick access.

2. **Post Management:**
    - Posts are created and linked to users through the **InstagramManager**.
    - Users can retrieve, edit, or delete their posts efficiently.

3. **Optimized Storage and Retrieval:**
    - Custom hash maps and hash sets allow for constant-time operations when accessing user or post data.

## Example Workflow
1. A user is created using the **User** class.
2. Posts are added to the user through the **InstagramManager**.
3. The system manages user-post relationships and retrieves content efficiently.
